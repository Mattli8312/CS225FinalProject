# Team Contract (ghk3-mlian5-rtm4)

## Communication

### Team Meetings

**The software we will use for team meetings will be Zoom or Discord, whichever suits our preferences. The time spent during these meetings will be mainly towards working on completing certain checkpoints of the project. :**

1. CheckPoint 1: Processing the data
    - The first checkpoint will involve being able to process the data, i.e. taking the csv file and converting it into a data structure. 

2. CheckPoint 2: Implementing algorithms
    - After creating the data structure, we will implement certain algorithms such as pathfinding or weighted algorithms to achieve the goal specified in the project proposal

3. Checkpoint 3: Making test Program:
    - Write sufficient tests to ensure functionality of our algorithms and data structures.

**In addition to these checkpoints, we will also complete other subtasks such as writing the makefile to compile the code or debugging code.**

### Assistance 

**Team members can be contacted via discord, snapchat, email, or any other means necessary.**

### Respect 

**Team members are expected to take all other's ideas into considerations and must not disregard opinions or thoughts of each others. All members must have the opportunity to speak or express their concerns with certain decisions made. Decisions will be expected based on majority vote.**

## Collaboration

### Work Distribution

**Work will be distributed amongst team members evenly and based on certain strengths. Two individuals may work on implementing a larger file such as the file used for building the graph or the algorithms file whilst another team member works on writing the test cases. If there are any unbalances in workloads, distributions of works may adjust accordingly.** 

### Time Commitment

**Team members are expected to work no less than 5 hours and no more than 12 hours per week in order to ensure even distribution of work amongst group members. If complications occur, team members may have to assist and invest their time in helping others. It is all team members' responsibility to ensure that the deliverables are complete by the end of the checkpoint, i.e. (MidPoint check, final deliverable).**

### Conflict Resolution

**All Conflicts will be met with a Super Smash Bros Ultimate match on rtm4's Nintendo Switch. No items except smash orb and 4 stocks. Whoever wins the round is correct and the loser must abide to the winner's statement.**
